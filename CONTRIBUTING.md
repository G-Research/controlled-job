# Contributing

We welcome comments, suggestions and pull requests to improve the ControlledJob project. See below for some pointers on how to get involved.

See [docs/development](docs/development) for some developer documentation.

The `ControlledJob` resource is widely relied upon for critical services at G-Research, and so we will be hesitant to make any functional or semantic changes to how the system works. You can increase the liklihood of a change being accepted by ensuring it is an opt-in feature and/or maintains backwards compatibility with how the system currently works
